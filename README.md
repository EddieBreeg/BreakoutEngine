# Breakout Engine

Breakout is a small C++ game engine. It is by no means meant to be an alternative
to the other engines out there, I just happen to be very interested in these things
and wanted to take a shot at creating my own ðŸ™‚.

## How To Build

Breakout uses [CMake](https://cmake.org) as its build system, so in theory building it should be as simple as:
- configuring the project, either via command line using the `cmake` command or via CMake Gui
- building it either with `cmake --build -B build`, or with the generated project files and the IDE of your choice
